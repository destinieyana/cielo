Initialize a new GIT repo on your GitHub account.
Branch off of master, and commit to your branch as you work, as if on a team.
Create a new MySQL Database on your LAMP stack.
Install CodeIgniter on your LAMP stack (http://ellislab.com/codeigniter) and get familiar with the docs: http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/
Build us a sample CI application, including a page that has a form, with the following fields:
Name 
Date of Birth
Email
Favorite Color
Submit Button
Perform some client-side validation using jQuery (with jquery.validate or the like), and some server-side validation on your choice of fields.
Create a MySQL table with the same fields to catch this data.
Insert validated form data to the MySQL table, and display a friendly success message.
OPTIONAL: submit the form via AJAX.
Once finished, and satisfied with your work, pretend your pull request was approved, and merge you branch commits into master.
Put a SQL dump into the code repo, so we can re-create your database.
Push it all up to GitHub.
